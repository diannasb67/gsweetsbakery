            <div class="box">
                <p>Passionate about his food, Chef Sanchez is unlike no other. His love
                    for
                    multicultural is unmeasurable. Born into an Italian and Puerto Rican family, food was part of his
                    identity. He grew up in the Bronx and around Arthur Avenue and his high was from the sugar lingering
                    in
                    the air. He worked hard to replicate the taste he remembered as a kid. What “G Sweets” is all about
                    is
                    Family, Memories and “G” In remembrance of “G”warreno” my G”randfather, who was the “G”reatest
                    Inspiration to me. Chef Sanchez is driven, he is creative and full of ambition something that you
                    want
                    and expect from a chef!</p>
